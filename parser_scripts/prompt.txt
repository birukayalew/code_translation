The following is unsafe chunk of Rust code produced by a transpiler.
```rust
'#![allow(dead_code, mutable_transmutes, non_camel_case_types, non_snake_case, non_upper_case_globals, unused_assignments, unused_mut)]\n#[no_mangle]\npub unsafe extern "C" fn insertion_sort(n: libc::c_int, p: *mut libc::c_int) {\n    let mut i: libc::c_int = 1 as libc::c_int;\n    while i < n {\n        let tmp: libc::c_int = *p.offset(i as isize);\n        let mut j: libc::c_int = i;\n        while j > 0 as libc::c_int && *p.offset((j - 1 as libc::c_int) as isize) > tmp {\n            *p.offset(j as isize) = *p.offset((j - 1 as libc::c_int) as isize);\n            j -= 1;\n            j;\n        }\n        *p.offset(j as isize) = tmp;\n        i += 1;\n        i;\n    }\n}'
```

This code has many non-idiomatic constructs, unnecessary operations, and memory safety hazards. Some of them are:

<EXAMPLE>
let mut i: libc::c_int = 1 as libc::c_int;
</EXAMPLE>
`libc::c_int` is not an idiomatic Rust type. In idiomatic Rust, you'd use `i32`.

<EXAMPLE>
while i < n {
    ...
    i += 1;
}
</EXAMPLE>
A `for` loop would be a more idiomatic and safe way to write this iteration.

<EXAMPLE>
*p.offset(i as isize);
</EXAMPLE>
Using a raw pointer with offset is unsafe and error-prone. Using slices or `Vec` with indexing is preferred in Rust.

<EXAMPLE>
i;
</EXAMPLE>
This is a no-op and can be safely removed.

And so on. There are potentially more such examples that can be pointed out in this program.

Now, here is another Rust chunk generated by a transpiler:
```rust
<CHUNK>
```
Can you point out instances of non-idiomatic constructs or potential memory safety hazards? Follow the same format as in the earlier example, with <EXAMPLE> and </EXAMPLE> tags.
