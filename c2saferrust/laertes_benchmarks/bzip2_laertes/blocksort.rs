         Step 3:
         The [ss] big bucket is now done.  Record this fact,
         and update the quadrant descriptors.  Remember to
         update quadrants in the overshoot area too, if
         necessary.  The "if (i < 255)" test merely skips
         this updating for the last bucket processed, since
         updating for the last bucket is pointless.

               then the relative values of quadrant[i] and
